# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
SQLite is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask and Django to display the data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier and will be scaling our dataset to remove outliers.  We will be using Linear Regression model to predict our outcome.

## Dashboard
Our Dashboard will be hosted on Heroku using Django and Flask as our dashboard integrated with SQlite backend.
