# UT-VIRT-DATA-GROUP-6-PROJECT

1. Description of the communication protocols:
   As a virtual team, we share the same goal - but we have different obligations and responsibilities outside of this project.              In order to reach our goal, we will communicate through Slack and work concurrently via Github. Group members are expected to            meet on Monday and Wednesday nights, communicate regularly, do their best to acheive goals, and reach out if issues arise.
        
2. Presentation
   - Select a topic:
     project topic:Particulate Matter and Hospitalizations and Death Rates due to COVID-19
     ![ParticulateMatter](Resources/ParticulateMatter.jpg)
     
   - Reason why we selected the topic:
     - We would like to know whether there is a strong relation between exposure to PM, which could increase the susceptibility and             severity of the COVID-19 patient symptoms, and hospitalizations and deaths rates due to COVID-19.
     - Availablity of COVID-19 and quality of air data for different counties.
     - An opportunity to apply the skills learned throughout this Boot Camp program.
    
   - Description of the source of our data: our data sources include:
     - United States Environmental Protecton Agency (EPA): the AirData Air   Quality Index Summary report provides an annual                    summary of air quality index values, which represent the quality of air in counties. However, not all places have air                    quality monitoring systems in place.

     - covidactnow.org:
       The Covid Act Now API provides access to all of our COVID data tracking US states, counties, and metros.It includes data and              metrics for cases, vaccinations, tests, hospitalizations, and deaths. 

   - Questions we hope to answer with the data
     - Is there a strong relation between exposure to PM, which could increase the susceptibility and severity of the COVID-19 patient          symptoms, and hospitalizations and deaths rates due to COVID-19?

     - Can this relation be modeled and then use to predict number of hopitalizations and possible deaths that could result from exposure        to particulates matter?
